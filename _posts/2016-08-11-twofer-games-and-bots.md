Time for another double bill (hence the picture, geddit?) you lucky things! We will see Graham Smith return to the stage to give us an update on his epic adventure to build a game in JavaScript, and Alexandre Nicol will deliver an introduction to creating bots in Node.js. More details on both to follow.
