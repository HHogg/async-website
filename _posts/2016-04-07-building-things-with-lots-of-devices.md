When developing a front-end, we make small, and frequent, changes to our code then refresh our browser to see the changes. Tooling helps us to automate this process; allowing us to see our updated content on several devices instantly.

In this talk, we’ll extend our tooling to support a larger number of devices and see the advantages of developing over a so many browsers simultaneously. We’ll cover issues of viewing, inspecting and debugging browsers at scale and also tackle some of the technical challenges with distributing changes to so many devices efficiently. I’ll also cover some practical applications of live content distribution.
