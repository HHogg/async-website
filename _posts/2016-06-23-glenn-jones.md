Service Workers are an exciting technology for the web, increasing the speed of pages loads and enabling sites to be accessed offline.  Building web content as pages on a remote server or in browsers using code and caches holds great potential.  Well thatâ€™s the promise; the reality is that these two environments are not equal.

In this talk Glenn will present a number of experiments on the crossovers of remote and client built user experiences. The aim, to find the edges of what features can be commonly provided across these two environments.

We will look at offline text search, geo search, dynamic facets and querying local data stored in the browser.  He will also explore how the Service Workers API, which was designed to cache pages and web resources, can be used with offline data.
