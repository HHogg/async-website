Async meets once a month in Brighton & Hove, UK, to learn, discuss and play
with JavaScript and related technologies.

We host talks, hack nights, show n' tells and community events, all of
which are free. Please sign up to each event you want to attend.

Doors open 7.15pm, main session begins 7.45pm, we end around 9.30pm and
continue nearby for an evening social.
